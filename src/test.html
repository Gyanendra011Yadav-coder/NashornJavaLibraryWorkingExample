<p>Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components
  to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI
  Applications. It is build on top of AWT API and acts as a replacement of
  AWT API, since it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls.
  Swing component follows a Model-View-Controller architecture to
  fulfill the following criterias.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>A single API is to be sufficient to support multiple look and feel.</p></li>
  <li><p>API is to be model driven so that the highest level API is not required to have data.</p></li>
  <li><p>API is to use the Java Bean model so that Builder Tools and IDE can provide better services to the developers for use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>MVC Architecture</h2>
<p>Swing API architecture follows loosely based MVC architecture in the following manner.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Model represents component's data.</p></li>
  <li><p>View represents visual representation of the component's data.</p></li>
  <li><p>Controller takes the input from the user on the view and reflects the changes in Component's data.</p></li>
  <li><p>Swing component has Model as a seperate element, while the View and Controller part are clubbed in the User Interface elements. Because of which, Swing has a pluggable look-and-feel architecture.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Swing Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Light Weight</b> − Swing components are independent of native Operating System's API as Swing API controls are rendered mostly using pure JAVA code instead of underlying operating system calls.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Rich Controls</b> − Swing provides a rich set of advanced controls like Tree, TabbedPane, slider, colorpicker, and table controls.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Highly Customizable</b> − Swing controls can be customized in a very easy way as visual apperance is independent of internal representation.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Pluggable look-and-feel</b> − SWING based GUI Application look and feel can be changed at run-time, based on available values.</p></li>
</ul>
